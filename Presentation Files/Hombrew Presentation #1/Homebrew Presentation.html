      <h2>Preface</h2>
      <p>So, thanks for taking part in the homebrew survey.
        Your input is very helpful for me, not just in deciding what I will work on first,
        but also in making me understand which ideas need more work and flashing out.<br>
        I thought what is the best way to present the results of the survey to you, and decided that
        this page was an interesting idea, so I hope you like it :)
      </p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>There have been many way to decide what the actual results are.
        They are mostly boring if you don't care about numbers,
        so here I tried to keep the explanations to a minimum.
      </p>
      <p>That being said, some understanding of the process is necessary for understanding the results.<br>
        Each homebrew was given a final score taking into account the 
        <span class="tooltip">
          <span class="tooltiptext">'Intresting', 'Special / Original', 'Fun', 'Include in our Game', 'Depth'</span>
          <span class="term">5 criteria</span>
        </span>,
        with each criteria having a different weight to it.
        <br> I had many choices for weighting each criteria, but mostly changed the weight of the "Special / Original"
        criteria.
        The final formula used is given as the title of the plot.
      </p>
      <div class="plot-container">
        <h3>Plot 1 - Chosen Formula</h3>
        <p>Here, I opted to give very little weight to how original you precived the homebrew as, since it's not a very
          important factor in my opinion.<br>
          Its also the final results, so if thats all you care about - congrats, you got it! </p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        So, what do I make of these results?<br>
        First, Heroic Soul was much better recived than I expected. Thats very cool, as I like the idea very much, but thought I'll
        be the only one for some reason.<br>
        Next is a suprise - Weapons sucking is somthing I am quite passionate about, but never expected to score high in the survey, 
        and never at second place! Being devoid of lore and mainly about dry mechanics was the reson for this pessimisem.
        I guess that the current situation is so boring that fixing it gives the idea all the glamour it needs :)<br>
        Prestige Classes and Oath of Inquisition scoring high is not surprising, as both seem to be interesting from mechanics, lore, and gameplay perspectives.<br>
        The fact that Oath of Corrosion scored high is somewhat surprising to me, but it might be due to it giving a "dark" twist to what paladin are.<br>
        How high Way of Five Animals is was another surprise for me - I mean, I like martial arts, and monks, but who knew you guys did as well?<br>
        The result for Skill Based BA is a surprise from the other direction, as I thought more bonus actions, and ones that relate to skills so 
        are available to everyone, would be a no brainer. I wonder if the got a low score because of a miscomunication of the idea, 
        or simply because they are less exciting than some other options (though, lower than <b>Cross Breeding?</b> Seriously?)<br>
        The result of both warlock subclasses is another unforseen event by me, as I always had the thought that warlocks are the "cool kid class", 
        and that any idea for subclasses there would be well recived. Guess I found my bias, right?<br>
        Effect of Aging being so low is sad, but expected. The idea needs lots of work to be both fun and playable, and the result mirrors that.<br>
        Last result I wanted to talk about is the Devil Sorcerer - this one baffles me. Like, is it so much worse than Fey? Why? 
        There is a canonic angel one (Divine Soul) that is well liked, what's so wrong about a devil one? Whats so wrong about devil Sorcerer that it is by far the least liked option? 
        I didn't expect it to be very high, but so low? Just wondering, let me know why you hate devils.<br><br>
        Next, some other options for what the final result could have been, if you are interested.

      <h2>Perliminary Analysis</h2>
      <p>So, from here on we will talk about the nitty gritty of how the Analysis was done.
        Many numbers follow, but not too many, don't worry.</p>

      <h3>The Process</h3>
      <p>So, what did I actually do?<br>
        The analysis had 3 main stages (some with sub stages):</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Data processing and scoring:</b> The code processes the survey data to calculate scores for each homebrew
          idea based on the specified features. It iterates through each "feature" in ['Intresting', 'Special /
          Original', 'Fun', 'Include in our Game', 'Depth'] and performs the following steps:
          <ol type="a">
            <li>If the current feature is 'Fun' or 'Include in our Game', it checks for really low scores (1 or 2) and
              prints a message about the number of such cases.</li>
            <li>Calculates the average and
              <span class="tooltip">
                <span class="tooltiptext">Basically, how different were the answers from each other</span>
                <span class="term">standard deviation </span>
              </span>
              for each idea's ratings on the current feature and computes a
              <span class="tooltip">
                <span class="tooltiptext">average - standard deviation, and a normalization to make it a
                  percentage</span>
                <span class="term"> normalized score. </span>
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>Creates two bar charts using plotly: one for the average rating with error bars and the other for the
              normalized score. The charts are saved and will be shown below.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li><b>Checking multiple scoring formulas:</b> The code defines four different scoring formulas (formula_A,
          formula_B,
          formula_C, and formula_D). These formulas assign weights to each feature (Include, Fun, Depth, Intresting, and
          Special) to calculate a final score for each homebrew idea.</li>
        <li><b>Final scoring and visualization:</b>The code iterates through each scoring formula and calculates the
          final score for
          each homebrew idea using that formula. It then creates a bar chart using plotly to display the final scores
          for
          each idea based on the current formula. These are the results shown above.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>following are the plots generated during the analysis.</p>

      <p>Aside from those, the analysis also generated warnings for low scores. The warnings were:<br>
        <code>
          Got 1 case of really low 'Fun' score in Effect of Aging<br>
          Got 1 case of really low 'Fun' score in Multiclassing Overhaul<br>
          Got 1 case of really low 'Fun' score in Wizard - School of Smoke<br>
          Got 1 case of really low 'Include in our Game' score in Effect of Aging<br>
          Got 1 case of really low 'Include in our Game' score in Barbarian - Path of the Spellshield<br>
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>Given more time, I would have given some more weight to these specific low scores in the analysis -
        if its extremely not fun, or extremely not something you would want in the game, I want the results to mirror that,
        since those are 2 really important factors. 
        <br>As it is, I think the results reflect these sentiments anyway, so no harm done. 
        <br><br>
        But let's talk about what I can learn from these really low scores, as it can be interesting:
        <ul>
          <li>Effect of Aging seems to be very poorly recived on both accounts. I would wager this has to do with some problem in how I presented it,
            since the 1st edition rules provided as an example seem very harsh and unforgiving (as was 1st edition). 
            <br> As mentioned in the first part, I think they need a substantial amount of work to make them work, but these results
            also emphasize that there need to be some extra care taken to make sure they are presented in a way that will seem appealing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Path of the Spellshield gets a low score, and I think the main issue with it is that its role and lore aren't very clear.
            The idea of an anti spellcaster warrior is very well liked (just look at the result of oath of inquisition), 
            so the main takeaway here is that more explanations were needed to fully portray the fantasy this subclass embodies.
          </li>
          <li>
            The last interesting result is low fun score for Multiclassing. I think this makes perfect sense - going to the doctor isn't fun,
            but necessary. This is something that the game needs, but giving it a low fun score makes sense.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
